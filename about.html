<a href="http://www.isitraininginjerusalem.shevagoldberg.com/">Is It Raining in Jerusalem?&nbsp;</a>is a site I made to answer the all important question of whether or not it's raining in Jerusalem. (Also because I was bored and had a bit of spare time.)<br />It uses <a href="http://webpy.org/">web.py</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;pulls data from&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/weather/">Yahoo Weather RSS feed</a>.
